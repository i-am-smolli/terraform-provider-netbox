# netbox_device_type (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/device-types/#device-types_1):

> A device type represents a particular make and model of hardware that exists in the real world. Device types define the physical attributes of a device (rack height and depth) and its individual components (console, power, network interfaces, and so on).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_manufacturer" "test" {
  name = "test"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test" {
  model           = "test"
  part_number     = "123"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
}
```
